## 🎯 Recommended Starting Point

**Start with Phase 1.1: Real-time Data Integration**

This will have the biggest immediate impact because:
1. It's what users expect from a "real-time" dashboard
2. It's relatively straightforward to implement
3. It will make the dashboard feel more professional
4. It sets the foundation for other features

Would you like me to start implementing the real-time data integration, or would you prefer to focus on a different area first?
